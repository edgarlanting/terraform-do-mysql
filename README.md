# terraform-do-mysql
  Roll out a couple MySQL servers on Digital Ocean with Terraform
 
 It's far from complete but it's a first try loosely based on ansible-role-mysql and Dima Medvedev's Bosun installation guide.
 Fun to tinker with terraform and Digital Ocean like this:-)

 This still needs some work as I haven't automated the MySQL install yet, it does have some basic Ansible stuff in it but like I said...It's
 a work in progress:-)
